            <h1>Hobby</h1>
            <p>In my quiet moments of leisure, I find joy in pursuing my passions, as hobbies are the threads that enrich our lives. 
            Each activity, whether itâ€™s art, music, or enjoying nature, serves as a source of inspiration and fulfillment.
             I enjoy cooking, painting, and exercising, but they are not my main hobbies. 
            Instead, I tend to focus on a few key pursuits that truly resonate with me.<span>my top 3 hobbies if i had to rank them would be</span> </p>
            <ol class="hobby-list">

            <p id="book" class="hidden">
                My favorite book of all time would be The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon, as it incisively examines the psychological and cultural effects of colonialism on African identity.
                Through passionate analysis and powerful insights, Fanon explores the struggles for liberation and the reclaiming of self. 
                This profound work has deepened my understanding of my own history and the ongoing quest for justice in Africa.
            </p>
            <p id="hiking" class="hidden">
                My favorite hiking spot is Mount Zebidar, which I visited during the Meskel Festival while staying with my grandmother.
                I hiked through the forests and took in the stunning views. 
                The experience of being in such a beautiful place with family made it truly special.
            </p>
            <p id="movie" class="hidden">
                Korean movies have become a fun hobby of mine, as they always bring a mix of excitement and heartfelt storytelling.
                I love getting lost in the vibrant characters and unique plots that each film offers. 
                It's a fantastic way to unwind and explore a different culture.

            <h1>Memories</h1>
            <p>Memories are the delicate threads that weave the fabric of our lives, each one a vivid brushstroke on our personal canvas. 
                My visits to ancient monasteries resonate deeply within me, offering a profound glimpse into the spiritual realm. 
                These sacred spaces invite contemplation, reshaping my understanding of the world and my place within it. 
                The serenity found there fosters a connection to something greater, influencing my thoughts long after I leave.
                Sharing these experiences with others amplifies their significance, creating bonds that enrich our lives. </p>
